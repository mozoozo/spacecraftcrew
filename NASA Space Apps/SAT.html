                          TIROS 1 was the first successful low-Earth orbital weather satellite, and the first in a series of infrared television observation satellites, launched by NASA and its partners April 1, 1960, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the United States. Whether satellites can be useful in studying the Earth. It has been proven useful.
                           The launch of TIROS I marked the first day that it became possible to regularly observe weather conditions on Earth, in most parts of the world from the point of view of outer space.

                          The spacecraft was 42 inches in diameter, 19 inches high, and weighed 270 pounds. The craft is made of aluminum alloy and stainless steel and then covered with 9,200 solar cells. Solar cells powered the batteries on board. Three pairs of solid-fueled Spin rockets were mounted on the base plate.
                          Two television cameras were placed in the craft, one low-resolution and one high-resolution. A magnetic tape recorder was provided to each camera to store images while the satellite was outside the ground stationâ€™s network.
                          The antennas consist of four rods from the base plate to act as transmitters and one vertical rod from the center of the top plate to act as a receiver <br><br>

                          The main TIROS-1 sensors that provided the cloud images were two television cameras. In particular, TIROS is equipped with slow-scanning cameras that capture footage of the scene below, captured every ten seconds. One of the cameras had a wide-angle lens that provided views of about 1,200 kilometers to a side (with the satellite looking straight down), while the other narrow-angle camera covered a view of about 129 kilometers from the side. When the satellite is in range of a ground station, Cameras can be asked to take a picture every 10, or every 30 seconds. But each camera was also connected to a clock-controlled recording device to record images when the satellite was out of range of a ground station. Each recorder can record up to 32 images for playback the next time the satellite is in range of one of the three command and data acquisition (CDA) stations.

                          TIROS-I has only been in operation for 78 days, but it has proven that satellites can be useful tools for surveying global weather conditions from space. <br><br>
                          On April 1, 1960, the US satellite TIROS-1 transmitted the first television image of Earth from space. <br><br>
                          Over the course of two and a half months, TIROS 1 returned 23,000 images of Earth, 19,000 of which are usable for weather analysis. For the first time, it was possible to display large-scale cloud patterns in their entirety, and from that to identify storm areas. The satellite provided the first long-range observations of a storm emerging from orbit, tracking the disintegration of a large cyclonic mass off the coast of Bermuda over the course of four days. In addition, TIROS 1 returned data on smaller structures such as hurricanes and jet streams, and the results returned from the satellite supplemented and corroborated the ground-based results. <br><br>
