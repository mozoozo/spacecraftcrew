A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/bartuc/pen/yMMyav](https://codepen.io/bartuc/pen/yMMyav).

Using THREEjs to create a model of the Earth. Using color, bump, and spec maps to get a more realistic look. I used the base of this program for my International Space Station Tracker. Use your mouse or finger to rotate the scene.
